# Code server

You can use vscode directly on your robot without installing anything on your remote.

```bash
curl -fsSL https://code-server.dev/install.sh | sh
```

Then you need to edit di config file at `~/.config/code-server/config.yaml` to setup access:

```yaml
bind-addr: 0.0.0.0:8081
auth: password
password: <your password>
cert: false
```

This allows to access your robot from another device connected on the same local netowork (computer, smartphone, tablet, etc) via:

`<your ip>:8081`
